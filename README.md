# Arc
Arc is a easy to use, configurable, and customizable minecraft webstore.
It's tech stack includes:
- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- ShadcnUI
- Supabase
- Postgres
- Drizzle

The current supported payment gateways are:
- Tebex

## Why?

I made this because I wanted to challenge myself to learn how payment gateways and e-commerce sites work.

This code is probably not production ready, and I do not recommend using it for your own store.
